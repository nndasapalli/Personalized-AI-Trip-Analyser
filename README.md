## Configuration & API Keys
   The application requires several API keys to function properly. Add these keys to your application.properties or environment variables:
      
         # Route planning
         openrouteservice.api.key=<YourOpenRouteServiceAPIKey>
         
         # Weather data
         openweathermap.api.key=<YourOpenWeatherMapAPIKey>
         
         # Geocoding / Location data
         geoapify.api.key=<YourGeoapifyAPIKey>
         opencage.api.key=<YourOpenCageAPIKey>
         
         # AI Model
         ollama.api.key=<YourOllamaAPIKey>

Make sure each key is valid and active. Without these keys, the corresponding features (route planning, weather info, geocoding, AI itinerary generation) will not work.
